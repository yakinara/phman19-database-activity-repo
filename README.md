# SQL Database Design (AWS Re/Start)
## An example project written in MySQL showing how to design a database suitable for subject schedule of students.

As part of the hands-on labs of the AWS Re/Start, we were tasked to design and implement a database. This project is an example showing how to do such activity. 

In this repository, I created a basic student database composed of 'Enrollments', 'Students', 'Courses', 'Faculty', and 'Departments' tables.  
This repo includes the database schema, sample queries, as well as the source code that can be imported in DB Fiddle.
Ensure to paste the '--SCHEMA' and '--INSERT DATA' code to the 'Schema SQL' window of the DB Fiddle and the '--QUERIES' on the 'Query SQL' window.
