Create a Basic Student Database:
		In this repository, I created a basic student database composed of 'Enrollments', 'Students', 'Courses', 'Faculty', and 'Departments' tables.  
		This repo includes the database schema, sample queries, as well as the source code that can be imported in DB Fiddle.
		Ensure to paste the '--SCHEMA' and '--INSERT DATA' code to the 'Schema SQL' window of the DB Fiddle and the '--QUERIES' on the 'Query SQL' window.
